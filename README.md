# learn-pytorch

## This repository is meant to act as a gateway to learning Pytorch.

## Getting Started

Installation: 
`git clone https://github.com/efar301/learn-pytorch.git`

All notebooks are also available on google colab if you dont want to clone the repo.

If you're new to Pytorch I recommend starting [here](./creating-environments/).
