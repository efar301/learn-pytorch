# learn-pytorch

## This repository is meant to act as a gateway to learning Pytorch.
I tried to simplify the basics to a degree that is understandable to someone completely new to pytorch. As this repository matures, I plan on adding more advanced topics. 

I would recommend having a basic working knowledge of the principles of deep learning before digging into this repository.

## Getting Started

Installation: 
`git clone https://github.com/efar301/learn-pytorch.git`

All notebooks are also available on google colab if you dont want to clone the repo.

If you're new to Pytorch I recommend starting [here](./tensors/tensor_operations.ipynb).

If you dont have a pytorch environment yet, you can make one [here](./creating-environments/).

## Example Models

There are some example models in [test-models](./test-models/) that can help you understand best practices for formatting your models in projects. More models will be added later.
